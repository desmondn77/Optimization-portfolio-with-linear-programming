## Overview
Linear programming is one of the powerful ways with mathematical concept that can help to optimize mathematical methods and models. The concept of linear optimization, which is derived from this linear programming, has wide applications in various fields. The use of this concept in financial markets has been done to some extent, but it is not common in its deep form.
Over the past few days I have been working on a linear optimization based code to arrive at an optimal asset portfolio. This code works by using an objective function and a series of constraints.
There are different solvers that are used to solve linear programming. Pulp and Pyomo are among these. Here scipy library is used to solve linear programming.
